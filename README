minetest-u_skins
================

Skins mod for minetest unified_inventory by Dean Montgomery - feel free to merge it into skinsdb or unified_inventory git.

Requires latest unified_inventory from:
https://github.com/minetest-technic/unified_inventory

This is the "u_skindb" branch, it is ment to download the skins from addi's skin database (http://minetest.fensta.bplaced.net).

To re-download the latest skins you have 2 ways:
	1, if you have blender) Run the script "update_from_db.py" OR "update_from_db2.py"
	and then "./generate_previews.sh"
	
	2, if you are lazy) Run the script "update_from_db_hacky.py"
	and then make sure, you have set "u_skins.used_hacky" to "true" in "./u_skins/init.lua"
